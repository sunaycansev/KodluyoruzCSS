            This New York Times bestseller was recommended to Gates by his wife
            Melinda. It’s a memoir by Edith Eger, who was sent to the death camp
            at Auschwitz when she was 16. Today, the Auschwitz survivor is a
            professional therapist. Eger reminds readers that there is no
            “hierarchy of suffering,” as she calls it in the book. “If you’re
            struggling with something, that struggle is real — even if you think
            your experience feels trivial compared to the experience of someone
            who survived Auschwitz or someone whose child is suffering from a
            terrible disease,” writes Gates. “I think this is an especially
            important thing to keep in mind right now while everyone has
            different experiences with the Covid-19 outbreak.”
